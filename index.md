I'm a Senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working toward my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering. I've done a wide range of internships and co-ops, including a multinational automation company, a small ruggedized, embedded computer design firm, and a well-known aerospace company. Through my undergrad, I've worked on four hyperloop pods. Most of my experience is firmly in the hardware world, but I figured it was time to put up some of my personal work on the internet.
