I'm an Senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working toward my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering. I've done a wide range of internships and co-ops, from a multinational automation company, to a small ruggedized computer subcontractor, to a well known aerospace company. Most of my experience is firmly in the hardware world, but I figured it was time to put up some of my work on the great void of the internet.
